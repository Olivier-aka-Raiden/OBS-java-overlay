# LiveFX

My stream layout as a web app (that OBS shows via an embedded browser).
This is a Spring Boot + React app.

To run this in development:

* launch the class `LiveFxApplication`
* in the root of the project:
    * run `nvm use`
    * run `npm run start`

Note that building the Spring Boot UberJAR works but the app within it doesn't.
